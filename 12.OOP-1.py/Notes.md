## Naming conventions
- _name: used to signify that something is intended to be used as internal class
- __name: name mingling. Python appends a class name 
- - __name__: used for Python specific methods
# Exmples:

# _name
# __name
# __name__


class Person:
	# Init is a "dunder" method
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Tony"
        # single underscore means "private" (sort of)
        self._secret = "hi!"
        # two leading underscores tells Python to "mangle" the name
        self.__msg = "I like turtles!"
        self.__lol = "HAHAHAHAH"


p = Person()

print(p.name)
print(p._secret) #Anyone can still directly access the attribute

print(dir(p)) # Notice what __msg and __lol have been "mangled" to

print(p._Person__msg)
print(p._Person__lol)
