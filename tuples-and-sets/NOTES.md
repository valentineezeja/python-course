# Tuples are different from lists in the sense that tuples are immutable

NB: assuming items is a disctionary {1,2,3,4}
running cat.items returns a tuple
while running cat will return a dictionary
Tuples are faster than sets and used to protect data that you don't want changed

# Tuple Methods:
- count
- index

# new concept: SETS
A collection of data that d0es not hac duplicate values and no ordering

# Set Methods:
- add
- remove (gives error if item does not exist)
- discard (does not give error)
- copy
- clear
## Set Math:
- union: a | b
- intersection: a & b
