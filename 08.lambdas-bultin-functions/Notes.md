Lambdas are functions that gets used once - hey are usually inline

# Lambda features:
- Map
- Filter: returns a boolean expression (T or F)
- sort: .sort works on lists only while sorted works on lists, tuples, dictionaries, and can be used
with Lambda.
- Min and Max
- reversed
- len
- abs (note that this does not automatically handle string. There is
an non-inbuilt function called fabs, which takes everything as float before conversion. It needs to be
imported using import math)
- sum()
- round()
