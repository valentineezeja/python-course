# Concept of scope:
A variable defined within a function is only available within the function

To use a variable defined outside the function to manipulate data within the function, you will
need to reference it as a **global scope**

The concept of non local scope also exists, used to reference a variable defined in the parent function within a nested/child
function (not global)
